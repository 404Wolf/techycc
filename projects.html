				<p>
					My most recent project is a github username transfer bot, to move usernames between github accounts without the risk of them being claimed while publically avalible.
					The bot is able to auth the github account, verify with an email otp, and then spam requests to change to the desired username, while at the same time one frees up the username
					they want to transfer.
					<br><br>
					I have been working on a project within the past few months to autoclaim minecraft usernames at the exact milisecond they drop.<br>
					When you change your username for Minecraft, the name becomes avalible to the public after 37 days,
					a time which is publically known. I have coded a queue system to automatically prepare and auth minecraft accounts on various servers, 
					briefly before the droptime of the name, and then automatically send requests to claim the name at the exact time of drop. While many names are 'sniped'
					by a plethora of other sniping organizations, I have obtained many decent usernames nonetheless, and have turned the project into a business, selling the
					accounts with valued usernames on them.
