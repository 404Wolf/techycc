                        Github Username Turbo
                    </a>

                    <p>
                        My most recent project is a github username transfer bot, to move usernames between github accounts without the risk of them being claimed while publically avalible.
                        The bot is able to auth the github account, verify with an email otp, and then spam requests to change to the desired username while the user frees up the username. I am keeping this project closed source for now, since being able to auth a github account automatically is something that could easily be abused.

                        NameMc Scraping API
                    </a>

                    <p>
                        Something that's been a pain in the past is scraping namemc.com, a minecraft profile social-media-like website. Namemc uses advanced cloudfare anti-scraping, making it very hard to
                        pull content from their website. To get the droptime of minecraft usernames, however, the use of namemc is vital, as Namemc has cached almost every username, and is able to check to see when people
                        change their usernames. Additionally, when a 'sniping' (autoclaiming) service 'snipes' a username, generally they send out an embed with information about the 'snipe,' including information pulled from NameMc.
                        While not the first NameMc api, I've created the only open source api for scraping NameMc data. The api uses a bypass which I have found, allowing discord to pull the information instead of a direct request. Discord, a popular chatting platform,
                        is able to auto-generate embed previews, with information from namemc, regardless of Namemc's harsh cloudfare protection.

                        Minecraft Username Sniping
                    </a>

                    <p>
                        An ongoing project of mine has been developing systems to autoclaim minecraft usernames at the exact milisecond they drop.
                        When you change your username for Minecraft, the name becomes avalible to the public after 37 days,
                        a time which is publically known. I have coded a queue system to automatically prepare and auth minecraft accounts on various servers, 
                        briefly before the droptime of the name, and then automatically send requests to claim the name at the exact time of drop. While many names are 'sniped'
                        by a plethora of other sniping organizations, I have obtained many decent usernames nonetheless, and have turned the project into a business, selling the
                        accounts with valued usernames on them.
